# Architecture (high-level)

- **Knowledge base:** small set of public Dell PDFs (VxRail, PowerStore, PowerFlex, PowerScale, services).
- **Process:** look-up relevant pages → generate structured outputs → export CSV/emails.
- **Privacy:** local-only prototype on a Mac (no external calls).
- **Salesforce fit:** outputs are paste/attach-ready (Notes, Files, Tasks).
