# BDM Copilot (Dell-focused, public-docs-only)

**What it does:**  
Paste discovery notes → get a market-aligned summary, 3 solution options with citations, a draft BOM (CSV), and three ready-to-send emails (customer recap, partner ask, SA handoff).

**Why it matters:**  
Saves 3–5 hours per opportunity; improves Salesforce hygiene; standardizes discovery quality.

**How it runs:**  
Local on a Mac using only public Dell documents. No internal systems. No customer data leaves the device.
